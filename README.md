## General Description
KnowShare is a Crowd Knowledge Contribution community-driven platform that allows users to share and contribute knowledge on a wide range of topics. It offer a user-friendly way of organizing and accessing articles based on various categories.

## Features
One of the key features is a linear versioning system that allows for multiple versions of an article.
If an admin notices an ill-intentioned modification, he can delete the modification respectively, the article returning to its previous form.

We've also implemented security features using HtmlSanitizer. This allows us to take untrusted documents or strings of HTML and sanitize them for safe insertion into a document's DOM, providing a safer and more secure user experience.

The app offers filtering options, enabling users to sort articles by category and chronologically or alphabetically. The search function allows users to easily find the content they're looking for by matching their search query with article titles and chapter contents.

We also offer a dedicated user management panel for administrators, providing enhanced profile settings, permission controls, and content management options. This feature ensures that our platform is secure and offers a safe and controlled environment for collaboration.
